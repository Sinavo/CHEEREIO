This testing workflow verifies that the most important aspects of the assimilation module are working properly.
It checks that state vectors are formed and subsetted properly, and that assimilation calculations are correct.
It also verifies that satellite operators are working as expected and that data is being passed across modules correctly.

However, not every scenario can be tested by this workflow, so please be careful!
This workflow also does not test the full CHEEREIO run, which involves running GEOS-Chem. It only works on assimilation.

Run this workflow every time you make modifications to the assimilation workflow, just to make sure you didn't break it!

TO RUN THIS WORKFLOW:
(1) activate your CHEEREIO conda environment.
(2) Run the command 'pytest' at the command line within this directory.
(3) Test results will be printed to the terminal.
