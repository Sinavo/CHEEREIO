The Template Run Directory
-------------

The CHEEREIO Template Run directory is essentially a standard GEOS-Chem run directory, generated by a routine within the ``setup_ensemble.sh`` script that is very much like the code that generates the standard GEOS-Chem run directory, though there are a few minor differences. This directory will then be copied by  ``setup_ensemble.sh`` to form the Spinup Run directory and the individual ensemble members within the Ensemble Runs directory. Users should make sure that the Template Run directory meets all their requirements before any further copying takes place.
