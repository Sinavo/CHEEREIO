Deploying the ensemble
==========

Because CHEEREIO requires many of the ensemble settings to be globally available to many different types of scripts and programs, written in different languages and stored in in different directories, it expects a very particular kind of installation process and for user settings to be made available in a strict format (so that they can be read by scripts in multiple languages). The overall install process is not too different from the way GEOS-Chem run directories are created as of version 13.0.0, but it does require some care on the part of the user. This page explains how to install the ensemble and customize it to meet your needs. This isn't merely a technical process: the user makes important scientific assumptions in this step!
